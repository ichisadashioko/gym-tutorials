    "This tutorial shows how to use PyTorch to train a Depp Q Learning (DQN) agent on the CartPole-v0 task from the OpenAI Gym.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task** The agent has to decide between two actions - moving the cart left or right - so that the pole attached to it stays upright. You can find an official leaderboard with varius algorithms and visualizations at the Gym website."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses an action, the environment *transitions* to a new state, and also returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more then 2.4 units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run longer duration, accumulating larger return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.). However, neural networks can solve the task purely by looking at the scene, so we'll use a patch of the screen centered on the cart as an input. Because of this, our results aren't directly comparable to the ones from the official leaderboard - our task is much harder. Unfortunately this does slow down the training, because we have to render all the frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, we will present the state as the difference between the current screen patch and the previous one. This will allow the agent to take the velocity of the pole into account from one image."

The discount, $\\gamma$, should be constant between $0$ and $1$ that ensures the sum converges. It makes rewards from the uncertain far future less important for our agent than the ones in the near future that it can be fairly confident about.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind Q-learning is that if we had a $Q^* : State x Action \\rightarrow R$, that could tell us what our return would be, if we were to taken an action in given state, then we could easily construct a policy that maximizes our rewards:\n",

But, since neural networks are universal function approximators, we can simply create one and train it to resemble $Q^*$.\n",

We calculate this over a batch of transitions $B$ sampled from the replay memory:\n",

    "Here, you can find an `optmize_model` function that performs a single step of optimization. It first samples a batch, concatenates all the tensors into a single one, computes $Q(s_t, a_t)$ and $v(s_t + 1) = \\max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a)$, and combines them into our loss. By definition we set $V(s) = 0$ if $s$ is a terminal state. We also use a target network to compute $v(s_{t+1})$ for added stability. The target network has its weights kept frozen most of the time, but is updated with the policy network's weights every so often. This is usually a set number of steps but we shall use episodes for simplicity."
